# Final Project for CSMC631

Finished Final Project. Proved Progress for an extended version of the
Simply Typed Lambda Calculus. I also showed a non terminating term and proved it. 

I want to thank 
Robert Rand for teaching CMSC631 and introducing us Coq and 
Cameron Moy for helping me narrow my focus on a smaller language then
Scheme.
