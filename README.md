# Final Project for CSMC631

Goal of this project is to _formalize_ parts of ISWIM which was a
hypothetical language created by Peter Landin for his article 
"The Next 700 Programming Languages". I will also be adding things
that Landin did not talk about but a lot of the original influence can be seen
especially in how I defined procedures and constants. 

I want to thank 
Robert Rand for teaching CMSC631 and introducing us Coq and 
Cameron Moy for helping me narrow my focus on a smaller language then
Scheme.
